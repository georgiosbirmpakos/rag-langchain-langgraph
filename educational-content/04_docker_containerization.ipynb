        "Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Our Greek Derby RAG chatbot uses Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments and simplify the development-to-production pipeline.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Traditional Deployment Problems:**\n",
        "- **\"It works on my machine\"** - Different environments behave differently\n",
        "- **Dependency Hell** - Conflicting software versions\n",
        "- **Complex Setup** - Manual installation of multiple services\n",
        "- **Environment Drift** - Production differs from development\n",
        "- **Scaling Issues** - Difficult to replicate and scale services\n",
        "\n",
        "**Containerization Benefits:**\n",
        "- **Consistency** - Same environment everywhere\n",
        "- **Isolation** - Applications don't interfere with each other\n",
        "- **Portability** - Run anywhere Docker is installed\n",
        "- **Scalability** - Easy to replicate and scale\n",

        "- **Fault Tolerance**: Service continues if one instance fails\n",

        "- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format for machine readability\n",
        "- **Log Levels**: Appropriate use of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR\n",
        "- **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, API keys, or PII\n",
        "- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to prevent disk full\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Alerting Best Practices**\n",
        "- **Meaningful Alerts**: Only alert on actionable issues\n",
        "- **Alert Fatigue**: Avoid too many false positives\n",
        "- **Escalation**: Different severity levels for different issues\n",

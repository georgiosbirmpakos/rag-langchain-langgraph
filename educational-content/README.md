## üöÄ How to Use These Lessons

1. **Open Jupyter Notebooks**: Use Jupyter Lab or VS Code with Jupyter extension
2. **Follow the Q&A Format**: Each lesson uses a question-answer structure for easy learning
3. **Run Code Examples**: Execute the code cells to see concepts in action
4. **Experiment**: Modify the examples to deepen your understanding

## üìñ Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of web development concepts
- Familiarity with APIs and HTTP protocols

## üéì Learning Objectives

By completing these lessons, you will understand:
- How to build modern web APIs with FastAPI
- How RAG systems work and how to implement them
- How to create responsive React applications
- How to containerize applications with Docker
- How to scrape and process web data
- How to implement DevOps CI/CD pipelines
- How to write clean, maintainable Python code
- How to integrate all these technologies into a complete system

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Install Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Lab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open the lessons** in your browser and start learning!

## üí° Tips for Learning

- **Read the questions first**: Try to answer them before reading the solutions
- **Run the code**: Don't just read, execute the examples
- **Experiment**: Modify parameters and see what happens
- **Take notes**: Jupyter notebooks support markdown cells for your notes
- **Ask questions**: Use the Q&A format to structure your learning
- **Start with Python Concepts**: If you're new to Python, begin with lesson 7 for a solid foundation
- **Follow the sequence**: Lessons build upon each other, so follow the numbered order
- **Practice regularly**: Each lesson includes practical exercises to reinforce learning
